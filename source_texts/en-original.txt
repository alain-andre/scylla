The area now called England was first inhabited by modern [[Homo sapien|humans]] during the [[Upper Palaeolithic]] period, but it takes its name from the [[Angles]], one of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries. England became a unified state in AD&nbsp;927, and since the [[Age of Discovery]], which began during the 15th century, has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world.<ref>{{cite web |title= England – Culture|url=http://www.britainusa.com/sections/index_nt1.asp?i=41105&L1=41105&L2=41105&D=0|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080516162153/http://www.britainusa.com/sections/index_nt1.asp?i=41105&L1=41105&L2=41105&D=0|archivedate=2008-05-16|publisher=britainusa.com|accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref> The [[English language]], the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]], and [[English law]]—the basis for the [[common law]] [[legal system]]s of many other countries around the world—developed in England, and the country's [[parliamentary system]] of government has been widely adopted by other nations.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/1038758.stm |title=Country profile: United Kingdom |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2009-02-01 | date=2009-10-26}}</ref> The [[Industrial Revolution]] began in 18th-century England, transforming its society into the world's first [[Industrialisation|industrialised]] nation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/Global_Warming/Older/Industrial_Revolution.html |publisher=Ace.mmu.ac.uk |title=Industrial Revolution|accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref> England's [[Royal Society]] laid the foundations of modern experimental science.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://royalsociety.org/page.asp?id=1058 |title=History of the Royal Society |publisher=royalsociety.org|author=The Royal Society|authorlink=Royal Society|accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref>

England's terrain mostly comprises low hills and plains, especially in central and southern England. However, there are uplands in the north (for example, the mountainous [[Lake District]], [[Pennines]], and [[Yorkshire Dales]]) and in the south west (for example, [[Dartmoor]] and the [[Cotswolds]]). [[London]], England's [[capital (political)|capital]], is the largest metropolitan area in the United Kingdom and the largest urban zone in the [[European Union]] by most measures.{{#tag:ref|According to the [[Eurostat|European Statistical Agency]], London is the largest [[Larger Urban Zones (LUZ) in the European Union|Larger Urban Zone]] which uses [[conurbation]]s and areas of high population as its definition.

Meadowlands and pastures are found beyond the major cities.

The [[Kingdom of England]]—which [[Statute of Rhuddlan|after 1284]] included Wales—was a sovereign state until 1&nbsp;May 1707, when the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] put into effect the terms agreed in the [[Treaty of Union]] the previous year, resulting in a [[political union]] with the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] to create the new [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].<ref>William E.

== Toponymy{{Anchor|Etymology}} ==<!--linked-->
{{see also|Toponymy of England}}
The name "England" is derived from the [[Old English]] name ''Engla land'', which means "land of the [[Angles]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=England|title=England|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=21 July 2010}}</ref> The Angles were one of the [[Germanic tribes]] that settled in Great Britain during the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The Angles came from the [[Angeln]] peninsula in the [[Bay of Kiel]] area of the [[Baltic Sea]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ripley|1869|p=570}}.</ref> According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the first known use of "England" to refer to the southern part of the island of Great Britain occurs in 897, and its modern spelling was first used in 1538.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50075354?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=England&first=1&max_to_show=10 |title=England|publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|accessdate=2009-09-05}}</ref>

The earliest attested mention of the name occurs in the 1st century work by [[Tacitus]], ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', in which the [[Latin]] word ''Anglii'' is used.<ref name="Fordham">{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/tacitus-germanygord.html |title= Germania|publisher=[[Tacitus]]|accessdate=2009-09-05}}</ref> The etymology of the tribal name itself is disputed by scholars; it has been suggested that it derives from the shape of the Angeln peninsula, an ''angular'' shape.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50075354?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=Angle&first=1&max_to_show=10 |title=Angle|publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|accessdate=2009-09-05}}</ref> How and why a term derived from the name of a tribe that was less significant than others, such as the [[Saxons]], came to be used for the entire country and its people is not known, but it seems this is related to the custom of calling the Germanic people in Britain ''Angli Saxones'' or English Saxons.<ref>{{harvnb|Crystal|2004| pp=26–27}}</ref> It may be worth noting that in [[Scottish Gaelic]], another language which developed on the island of Great Britain, it was the dominant Saxon tribe who gave their name to the word for 'England' ("Sasunn").<ref>{{cite book|last=Forbes|first=John|title=The Principles of Gaelic Grammar|year=1848|publisher=Oliver, Boyd and Tweeddale|location=Edinburgh}}</ref> 

An alternative name for England is [[Albion]]. The name ''Albion'' originally referred to the entire island of Great Britain. The earliest record of the name appears in the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[Corpus Aristotelicum|Corpus]], specifically the 4th century BC ''De Mundo'':<ref name="massey">{{harvnb|Massey|2007|p=440}}.</ref> "Beyond the [[Pillars of Hercules]] is the ocean that flows round the earth. In it are two very large islands called Britannia; these are [[Albion]] and [[Ireland|Ierne]]".<ref name="massey"/> The word ''[[Albion]]'' (Ἀλβίων) or ''insula Albionum'' has two possible origins. It either derives from a cognate of the Latin ''albus'' meaning white, a reference to the [[white cliffs of Dover]], the only part of Britain visible from the European Continent,<ref>{{harvnb|Room|2006|p=23}}.</ref> or from the phrase in ''[[Massaliote Periplus]]'', the "island of the ''Albiones''".<ref>{{harvnb|Major|2004|p=84}}.</ref> ''Albion'' is now applied to England in a more poetic capacity.<ref>{{harvnb|Foster|1988|p=9}}.</ref> Another romantic name for England is [[Lloegyr|Loegria]], related to the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] word for England, ''Lloegr'', and made popular by its use in [[Arthurian legend]].

The earliest known evidence of human presence in the area now known as England was that of ''[[Homo antecessor]]'', dating to approximately 780,000 years ago.

After the last [[Last glacial period|ice age]] only large mammals such as [[mammoth]]s, [[bison]] and [[woolly rhinoceros]] remained. Roughly 11,000&nbsp;years ago, when the ice sheets began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests they came from the northern part of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].<ref>{{harvnb|Oppenheimer|2006|p=173}}.</ref> The sea level was lower than now, and Britain was connected by land to both Ireland and [[Eurasia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qpg.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/tertiaryrivers/tectonics.html |title=Tertiary Rivers: Tectonic and structural background |publisher=University of Cambridge |accessdate=2009-09-09}}</ref>
As the seas rose, it was separated from Ireland 10,000&nbsp;years ago and from Eurasia two millennia later.

The [[Beaker culture]] arrived around 2500&nbsp;BC, introducing drinking and food vessels constructed from clay, as well as vessels used as reduction pots to smelt copper ores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tp.revistas.csic.es/index.php/tp/article/viewFile/5/5|title=Function and significance of Bell Beaker pottery according to data from residue analyses|accessdate=21 December 2010}}</ref> It was during this time that major [[Neolithic]] monuments such as [[Stonehenge]] and [[Avebury]] were constructed. By heating together tin and copper, both of which were in abundance in the area, the Beaker culture people made [[bronze]], and later [[iron]] from [[iron ore]]s. The development of iron [[smelting]] allowed the construction of better [[plough]]s, advancing agriculture (for instance, with [[Celtic field]]s), as well as the production of more effective weapons.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=bn88JPk_Fr0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=inventions+in+trade#v=onepage&q&f=false|last=Reid|first=Struan|title=Inventions and Trade.

According to [[John T. Koch]] and others, England in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading-networked culture called the [[Atlantic Bronze Age]] that included the whole of the British Isles and much of what we now regard as France together with the Iberian Peninsula. [[Celtic languages]] developed in those areas; [[Tartessian language|Tartessian]] may have been the earliest written Celtic language.<ref name=Koch2009>{{cite book | last = Koch | first = John | title = Tartessian: Celtic from the Southwest at the Dawn of History in Acta Palaeohispanica X Palaeohispanica 9 (2009)| publisher=Palaeohispanica | year = 2009 | location = | pages = 339–351 | url = http://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/29/54/26koch.pdf | doi = | id = | issn = 1578-5386 | accessdate = 2010-05-17 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Cunliffe, Karl, Guerra, McEvoy, Bradley; Oppenheimer, Rrvik, Isaac, Parsons, Koch, Freeman and Wodtko |title=Celtic from the West: Alternative Perspectives from Archaeology, Genetics, Language and Literature |year=2010|publisher=Oxbow Books and Celtic Studies Publications |isbn=978-1-84217-410-4 |page=384 |url=http://www.oxbowbooks.com/bookinfo.cfm/ID/88298//Location/DBBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Cunliffe |first=Barry |title=A Race Apart: Insularity and Connectivity in Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 75, 2009 |year=2008| publisher=The Prehistoric Society |page=61}}</ref>

During the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]], [[Celts|Celtic culture]], deriving from the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] and [[La Tène culture]]s, arrived from Central Europe. [[British language (Celtic)|Brythonic]] was the spoken language during this time. Society was tribal; according to [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia]]'' there were around 20 different tribes in the area. However, earlier divisions are unknown because the Britons were not literate. Like other regions on the edge of the Empire, Britain had long enjoyed trading links with the Romans. Julius Caesar of the [[Roman Republic]] attempted to [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|invade twice]] in 55&nbsp;BC; although largely unsuccessful, he managed to set up a [[Roman client kingdoms in Britain|client king]] from the [[Trinovantes]].

The Romans invaded Britain in AD&nbsp;43 during the reign of Emperor [[Claudius]], subsequently [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquering much of Britain]], and the area was incorporated into the Roman Empire as [[Britannia province]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,406152,00.html |title=Dig uncovers Boudicca's brutal streak |accessdate=2009-09-05 |work=The Observer |location=London | first=Jason | last=Burke | date=2 December 2000 }}</ref> The best-known of the native tribes who attempted to resist were the [[Catuvellauni]] led by [[Caratacus]].

There is debate about when Christianity was first introduced; it was no later than the 4th century, with probability lying much earlier. According to [[Bede]], missionaries were sent from [[Rome]] by [[Pope Eleuterus|Eleutherius]] at the request of the chieftain [[Lucius of Britain]] in AD 180 to settle controverted points of differences as to Eastern and Western ceremonials which were disturbing the church. There are, however, traditions linked to Glastonbury claiming an introduction through [[Joseph of Arimathea]], while others claim through [[Lucius of Britain]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2008|p=143}}.</ref> By 410, as the Empire [[Decline of the Roman Empire|declined]], Britain was left exposed by the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|withdrawal of Roman army units]], to defend the frontiers in continental Europe and partake in civil wars.<ref name="james_anglosaxons" />

[[File:Sutton Hoo replica (face).jpg|thumb|alt=Studded and decorated metallic mask of human face.|left|Replica of a 7th century ceremonial helmet from the [[Kingdom of East Anglia]], found at [[Sutton Hoo]].]]
Roman military withdrawals left Britain open to invasion by pagan, seafaring warriors from north-western continental Europe, chiefly the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]] who had long raided the coasts of the Roman province and now began to settle, initially in the eastern part of the country.<ref name="james_anglosaxons">{{cite web |title=Overview: Anglo-Saxons, 410 to 800|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/anglo_saxons/overview_anglo_saxons_01.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2010-12-03|first=Edward|last=James}}</ref> Their advance was contained for some decades after the Britons' victory at the [[Battle of Mons Badonicus|Battle of Mount Badon]], but subsequently resumed, over-running the fertile lowlands of Britain and reducing the area under [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] control to a series of separate enclaves in the more rugged country to the west by the end of the 6th century. Contemporary texts describing this period are extremely scarce, giving rise to its description as a [[Dark Age]]. The nature and progression of the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]] is consequently subject to considerable disagreement. Christianity had in general disappeared from the conquered territories, but was reintroduced by missionaries from Rome led by [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]] from 597 onwards and by Irish missionaries led by [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Aidan]] around the same time.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Christian Tradition|url=http://www.picturesofengland.com/history/england-history-p4.html|publisher=PicturesofEngland.com|accessdate=2009-09-05}}</ref> Disputes between the varying influences represented by these missions ended in victory for the Roman tradition.

During the settlement period the lands ruled by the incomers seem to have been fragmented into numerous tribal territories, but by the 7th century, when substantial evidence of the situation again becomes available, these had coalesced into roughly a dozen kingdoms including [[Northumbria]], [[Mercia]], [[Wessex]], [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]], [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] and [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]]. Over the following centuries this process of political consolidation continued.<ref>{{harvnb|Kirby|2000|p=4}}</ref> The 7th century saw a struggle for hegemony between Northumbria and Mercia, which in the 8th century gave way to Mercian preeminence.<ref>{{harvnb|Lyon|1960|p=23}}.</ref> In the early 9th century Mercia was displaced as the foremost kingdom by Wessex. Later in that century escalating attacks by the [[Danes]] culminated in the conquest of the north and east of England, overthrowing the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and East Anglia. Wessex under [[Alfred the Great]] was left as the only surviving English kingdom, and under his successors it steadily expanded at the expense of the kingdoms of the [[Danelaw]]. This brought about the political unification of England, first accomplished under [[Æthelstan]] in 927 and definitively established after further conflicts by [[Eadred]] in 953. A fresh wave of [[Scandinavia]]n attacks from the late 10th century ended with the conquest of this united kingdom by [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] in 1013 and again by his son [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] in 1016, turning it into the centre of a short-lived [[North Sea]] empire that also included [[Kingdom of Denmark|Denmark]] and [[Norway]].

[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] broke from communion with the Catholic Church, over issues relating to divorce, under the [[Acts of Supremacy]] in 1534 which proclaimed the monarch head of the [[Church of England]]. In contrast with much of European Protestantism, the [[English Reformation|roots of the split]] were more political than theological.{{#tag:ref|As [[Roger Scruton]] explains, "The Reformation must not be confused with the changes introduced into the Church of England during the 'Reformation Parliament' of 1529–36, which were of a political rather than a religious nature, designed to unite the secular and religious sources of authority within a single sovereign power: the Anglican Church did not until later make substantial change in doctrine".<ref>{{harvnb|Scruton|1982|p=470}}.</ref>|group=note}} He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|1535–1542 acts]].

The [[subdivisions of England]] consist of up to four levels of [[administrative division|subnational division]] controlled through a variety of types of administrative entities created for the purposes of [[local government in England|local government]]. The highest tier of local government were the nine [[regions of England]]: [[North East England|North East]], [[North West England|North West]], [[Yorkshire and the Humber]], [[East Midlands]], [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], [[East of England|East]], [[South East England|South East]], [[South West England|South West]], and [[London]]. These were created in 1994 as [[Government Office]]s, used by the British Government to deliver a wide range of policies and programmes regionally, but there are no elected bodies at this level, except in London, and in 2011 the regional Government offices were abolished.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tiers shed as regional government offices disappear|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/mar/29/regional-government-disappears-1500-jobs-lost |publisher=guardian.co.uk |accessdate=2011-06-16 |location=London |first=Hilary |last=Cooper |date=29 March 2011}}</ref> The same boundaries remain in use for electing [[Members of the European Parliament]] on a regional basis.

After [[devolution]] began to take place in other parts of the United Kingdom it was planned that referendums for the regions of England would take place for their own elected [[Regional Assemblies in England|regional assemblies]] as a counterweight. [[Greater London Authority referendum, 1998|London accepted]] in 1998: the [[London Assembly]] was created two years later. However, when the proposal was rejected by the [[northern England devolution referendums, 2004]] in the North East, further referendums were cancelled.<ref name="refreject">{{cite news |title=Prescott's dream in tatters as North East rejects assembly |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article503255.ece |work=The Times |location=London |accessdate=2009-09-05 | first1=Jill | last1=Sherman | first2=Andrew | last2=Norfolk | date=5 November 2004}}</ref> The regional assemblies outside London were abolished in 2010, and their functions transferred to respective [[Regional Development Agency|Regional Development Agencies]] and a new system of [[local authority leaders' board]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prosperous Places|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/citiesandregions/pdf/1073344.pdf|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ln5KtF1u|archivedate=2009-12-05 |publisher=communities.gov.uk |accessdate=2009-09-05 |author=Department for Communities and Local Government|authorlink=Department for Communities and Local Government}}</ref>

There are six [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]] based on the most heavily urbanised areas, which do not have county councils.<ref name="localgov" /> In these areas the principal authorities are the councils of the subdivisions, the [[metropolitan borough]]s. Elsewhere, 27 [[non-metropolitan county|non-metropolitan "shire" counties]] have a [[county council]] and are divided into districts, each with a district council. They are typically, though not always, found in more rural areas. The remaining non-metropolitan counties are of a single district and usually correspond to large towns or counties with low populations; they are known as [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authorities]]. Greater London has a different system for local government, with 32 [[London borough]]s, plus the [[City of London]] covering a small area at the core, governed by the [[City of London Corporation]].<ref>{{harvnb|Axford|2002|p=315}}.</ref> At the most localised level, much of England is divided into [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]]es with [[Parish councils in England|councils]]; they do not exist in Greater London.<ref>{{harvnb|Singh|2009|p=54}}.</ref>

Geographically England includes the central and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain, plus such offshore islands as the [[Isle of Wight]] and the [[Isles of Scilly]]. It is bordered by two other countries of the United Kingdom—[[Anglo Scottish border|to the north]] by Scotland and [[Wales-England border|to the west]] by Wales. England is closer to the European continent than any other part of mainland Britain. It is separated from [[France]] by a {{convert|34|km|mi|adj=on}}<ref name="Engchannel">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/187921/English-Channel|title=English Channel|year=2009|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|publisher=britannica.com|accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> sea gap, though the two countries are connected by the [[Channel Tunnel]] near [[Folkestone]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History|url=http://www.eurotunnel.com/ukcP3Main/ukcCorporate/ukcAboutUs/ukm/history.htm|publisher=EuroTunnel.com|accessdate=2009-09-05}}</ref> England also has shores on the [[Irish Sea]], [[North Sea]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]].

The ports of London, [[Liverpool]], and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] lie on the tidal rivers [[River Thames|Thames]], [[River Mersey|Mersey]] and [[River Tyne|Tyne]] respectively. At {{convert|354|km|mi}}, the [[River Severn|Severn]] is the longest river flowing through England.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/england/sevenwonders/west/severn-river/ | publisher=BBC | title=The River Severn|accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref> It empties into the [[Bristol Channel]] and is notable for its [[Severn Bore]] tidal waves, which can reach {{convert|2|m|ft}} in height.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/recreation/31439.aspx | title=Severn Bore and Trent Aegir | publisher=Environment Agency|accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref> However, the longest river entirely in England is the Thames, which is {{convert|346|km|mi}} in length.<ref name="Thames">{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-home/related-139-94056-articles-reviews/River+Thames-London+(England)/related.do|title=River Thames and London (England)|work=London Evening Standard|publisher=ThisisLondon.co.uk|accessdate=2009-08-17}}</ref> There are many [[lakes in England]]; the largest is [[Windermere]], within the aptly named [[Lake District]].<ref name="metoffice_nw">{{cite web | url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/nw/|title=North West England & Isle of Man: climate|publisher=Met Office|accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref>

In geological terms, the [[Pennines]], known as the "backbone of England", are the oldest range of mountains in the country, originating from the end of the [[Paleozoic Era]] around 300&nbsp;million years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.summitpost.org/area/range/220026/pennines.html|title=Pennines|publisher=Smmit Post|accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref> Their geological composition includes, among others, [[sandstone]] and [[limestone]], and also [[coal]]. There are [[karst]] landscapes in calcite areas such as parts of Yorkshire and [[Derbyshire]]. The Pennine landscape is high [[moorland]] in upland areas, indented by fertile valleys of the region's rivers. They contain three [[national parks in England|national parks]], the [[Yorkshire Dales]], [[Northumberland National Park|Northumberland]], and the [[Peak District]]. The highest point in England, at {{convert|978|m|ft}}, is [[Scafell Pike]] in Cumbria.<ref name="metoffice_nw" /> Straddling the border between England and Scotland are the [[Cheviot Hills]].

The [[English Lowlands beech forests|English Lowlands]] are to the south of the Pennines, consisting of green rolling hills, including the [[Cotswold Hills]], [[Chiltern Hills]], [[North Downs|North]] and [[South Downs]]—where they meet the sea they form white rock exposures such as the [[cliffs of Dover]]. The granite Southwest Peninsula in the [[West Country]] includes upland moorland, such as [[Dartmoor]] and [[Exmoor]], and enjoys a [[Climate of south-west England|mild climate]]; both are national parks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/aboutus|title=National Parks – About us|publisher=nationalparks.gov.uk|accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref>

The [[Department for Transport]] is the government body responsible for overseeing transport in England. There are many [[List of motorways in the United Kingdom|motorways in England]], and many other trunk roads, such as the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 Great North Road]], which runs through eastern England from London to Newcastle<ref name="roads">{{harvnb|UK Parliament|2007|p=175}}</ref> (much of this section is motorway) and onward to the Scottish border. The longest motorway in England is the [[M6 motorway|M6]], from [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] through the [[North West England|North West]] up to the [[Anglo-Scottish border]].<ref name="roads" /> Other major routes include: the [[M1 motorway|M1]] from London to Leeds, the [[M25 motorway|M25]] which encircles London, the [[M60 motorway|M60]] which encircles Manchester, the [[M4 motorway|M4]] from London to South Wales, the [[M62 motorway|M62]] from Liverpool via Manchester to East Yorkshire, and the [[M5 motorway|M5]] from Birmingham to Bristol and the South West.<ref name="roads" />

[[Bus]] transport across the country is widespread; major companies include [[National Express Group|National Express]], [[Arriva]] and [[Go-Ahead Group]]. The red [[double-decker bus]]es in London have become a symbol of England. There is a [[rapid rail]] network in two English cities: the [[London Underground]]; and the [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] in Newcastle, Gateshead and Sunderland.<ref name="pubwhite">{{harvnb|White|2002|p=63}}.</ref> There are several tram networks, such as the [[Blackpool tramway]], [[Manchester Metrolink]], [[Sheffield Supertram]] and [[Midland Metro]], and the Tramlink system centred on Croydon in South London.<ref name="pubwhite" />

[[Rail transport in England]] is the oldest in the world: passenger railways originated in England in 1825.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/johnmoore/1825/sept_27.htm|title=27 September 1825&nbsp;– Opening of the Stockton and Darlington Railway|publisher=The Stockton and Darlington Railway|accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref> Much of Britain's {{convert|16116|km|mi}} of rail network lies in England, covering the country fairly extensively, although a high proportion of railway lines were closed in the second half of the 20th century. These lines are mostly standard gauge ([[single track (rail)|single]], [[double track|double]] or [[quadruple track]]) though there are also a few [[British narrow gauge railways|narrow gauge lines]]. There is rail transport access to France and Belgium through an undersea rail link, the [[Channel Tunnel]], which was completed in 1994.

England has extensive domestic and international [[aviation]] links. The largest airport is [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]], which is the [[World's busiest airports by international passenger traffic|world's busiest airport measured by number of international passengers]].<ref name=wsj230211>{{Cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110223-710213.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0OE2ky|archivedate=2011-05-19|title=Delta Expects New Slots To Foster Growth At Heathrow Airport|accessdate=23 March 2011|publisher=The Wall Street Journal| date=23 February 2011}}</ref> Other large airports include [[Manchester Airport]], [[London Stansted Airport]], [[Luton Airport]] and [[Birmingham Airport, England|Birmingham Airport]].<ref name="airports" /> By sea there is [[ferry]] transport, both local and international, including to Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium.<ref name="waterworks">{{harvnb|Else|2007|p=781}}.</ref> There are around {{convert|7100|km|mi|-2|abbr=on}} of navigable waterways in England, half of which is owned by [[British Waterways]] ([[Waterscape]]),<ref name="waterworks" /> however water transport is very limited. The [[river Thames|Thames]] is the major waterway in England, with imports and exports focused at the [[Port of Tilbury]] in the Thames Estuary, one of the United Kingdom's three major ports.<ref name="waterworks" />

The [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] (NHS) is the [[Socialised medicine|publicly funded healthcare system]] in England responsible for providing the majority of healthcare in the country. The NHS began on 5 July 1948, putting into effect the provisions of the [[National Health Service Act 1946]]. It was based on the findings of the [[Beveridge Report]], prepared by economist and social reformer [[William Beveridge]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/beveridge_william.shtml|title=BBC History on William Beveridge|accessdate= 2009-09-05|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> The NHS is largely funded from general taxation including [[National Insurance]] payments,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsg-00724.pdf | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ln5L5oTN | archivedate=2009-12-05| title=NHS Expenditure in England |format=PDF | work=House of Commons Library | accessdate= 2009-09-05}}</ref> and it provides most of its services free at the point of use, although there are charges for some people for eye tests, dental care, prescriptions and aspects of personal care.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/Medicinespharmacyandindustry/Prescriptions/NHScosts/DH_087013| title=NHS costs and exemptions| work=Department of Health| accessdate= 2009-09-05}} {{Dead link|date=June 2010| bot=DASHBot}}</ref>

[[File:Anglospeak.svg|thumb|right|The [[English-speaking world]]. Countries in dark blue have a majority of native speakers.

As its name suggests, the English language, today spoken by hundreds of millions of people around the world, originated as the language of England, where it remains the principal tongue today. It is an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language in the [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] branch of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] family.<ref>{{harvnb|Arlotto|1971|p=108}}.</ref> After the [[Norman Conquest of England|Norman conquest]], the [[Old English|Old English language]] was displaced and confined to the lower social classes as [[Norman language|Norman French]] and [[Latin]] were used by the aristocracy.

By the 15th century, English came back into fashion among all classes, though much changed; the [[Middle English]] form showed many signs of French influence, both in vocabulary and spelling. During the [[English Renaissance]], many words were coined from Latin and Greek origins.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2003|p=13}}.</ref> [[Modern English]] has extended this custom of flexibility, when it comes to incorporating words from different languages. Thanks in large part to the British Empire, the English language is the world's unofficial ''[[lingua franca]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=English: Not America's Language? |url=http://www.theglobalist.com/DBWeb/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=3229 | first = Mauro E. | last = Mujica | date = 19 June 2003 | location = Washington DC |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080117232711/http://www.theglobalist.com/DBWeb/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=3229 |archivedate=2008-01-17 |work=The Globalist |accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref>

[[English language learning and teaching]] is an important economic activity, and includes [[language schools|language schooling]], tourism spending, and publishing.

Christianity is the most widely practised religion in England, as it has been since the Early Middle Ages, although it was first introduced much earlier, in Gaelic and Roman times.

There are [[High Church]] and [[Low Church]] traditions, and some Anglicans regard themselves as [[Anglo-Catholics]], after the [[Tractarian movement]]. The monarch of the United Kingdom is a titular leader of the Church, acting as its [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]].

The second largest Christian practice is the [[Latin Rite]] of the Catholic Church, which traces its formal, corporate history in England to the 6th century with [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine's mission]] and was the main religion on the entire island for around a thousand years. Since its reintroduction after the [[Catholic Emancipation]], the Church has organised ecclesiastically on an [[Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales|England and Wales]] basis where there are 4.5&nbsp;million members (most of whom are English).<ref>{{cite news |title=People here 'must obey the laws of the land'|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1578212/People-here-must-obey-the-laws-of-the-land.html|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London|accessdate=2009-09-05 | date=2008-02-09}}</ref> There has been one Pope from England to date, [[Pope Adrian IV|Adrian IV]]; while saints [[Bede]] and [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]] are regarded as [[Doctors of the Church]].

=== Architecture ===
[[File:St Pauls Cathedral, London.jpg|thumb|alt=White stone building with tower topped with a dome. In the foreground are trees and a red rectangular vertical box with windows.|right|upright|[[St Paul's Cathedral]], [[English Baroque]]]]
Many ancient [[standing stone]] monuments were erected during the prehistoric period, amongst the best known are [[Stonehenge]], [[Devil's Arrows]], [[Rudston Monolith]] and [[Castlerigg stone circle|Castlerigg]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.stone-circles.org.uk/stone/index.htm|publisher=Stone-Circles.org.uk|title=The Prehistoric Sites of Great Britain|accessdate=2009-09-05}}</ref> With the introduction of [[Ancient Roman architecture]] there was a development of [[basilicas]], [[Roman baths|baths]], [[amphitheaters]], [[triumphal arch]]es, [[villa]]s, [[Roman temple]]s, [[Roman road]]s, [[Roman fort]]s, [[stockade]]s and [[aqueduct]]s.<ref name="roman">{{cite web |url=http://www.castles.me.uk/ancient-roman-architecture-england-wales.htm|publisher=Castles.me.uk|title=Ancient Roman architecture in England and Wales|accessdate=2009-09-05}}</ref> It was the Romans who founded the first cities and towns such as London, Bath, York, Chester and St Albans. Perhaps the best known example is [[Hadrian's Wall]] stretching right across northern England.<ref name="roman" /> Another well preserved example is the [[Roman Baths (Bath)|Roman Baths]] at [[Bath, Somerset]].<ref name="roman" />

[[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Early Medieval architecture's]] secular buildings were simple constructions mainly using [[timber]] with [[thatch]] for roofing. Ecclesiastical architecture ranged from a synthesis of [[Early Christian Ireland|Hiberno]]—[[Germanic Christianity|Saxon]] [[monasticism]],<ref>{{harvnb|Colgrave|1985|p=326}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Pevsner|1942|p=14}}.</ref> to [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]] [[basilica]] and architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings. After the Norman conquest in 1066 various [[Castles in England]] were created so law lords could uphold their authority and in the north to protect from invasion. Some of the best known medieval castles include the [[Tower of London]], [[Warwick Castle]], [[Durham Castle]] and [[Windsor Castle]] amongst others.<ref name="buildings" />

[[File:Broadway tower edit.jpg|thumb|alt=Yellow stone tower with two circular turrets which run the height of the building.|left|The [[Broadway Tower]] is a [[folly]], or mock tower, in [[Worcestershire]].]]
Throughout the Plantagenet era an [[English Gothic architecture]] flourished—the [[Architecture of the medieval cathedrals of England|medieval cathedrals]] such as [[Canterbury Cathedral]], [[Westminster Abbey]] and [[York Minster]] are prime examples.<ref name="buildings">{{harvnb|Atkinson|2008|p=189}}.</ref> Expanding on the [[Norman architecture|Norman base]] there was also [[castle]]s, [[palace]]s, [[List of historic houses in England|great houses]], [[university|universities]] and [[parish church]]es. Medieval architecture was completed with the 16th century [[Tudor architecture|Tudor style]]; the four-centred arch, now known as the [[Tudor arch]], was a defining feature as were [[wattle and daub]] houses domestically. In the aftermath of the [[Renaissance]] a form of architecture echoing classical antiquity, synthesised with Christianity appeared—the [[English Baroque]] style, architect [[Christopher Wren]] was particularly championed.<ref>{{harvnb|Downes|2007|p=17}}.</ref>

[[Georgian architecture]] followed in a more refined style, evoking a simple Palladian form; the [[Royal Crescent]] at Bath is one of the best examples of this. With the emergence of [[romanticism]] during Victorian period, a [[Gothic Revival]] was launched—in addition to this around the same time the Industrial Revolution paved the way for buildings such as [[The Crystal Palace]]. Since the 1930s various [[modernist architecture|modernist]] forms have appeared whose reception is often controversial, though traditionalist resistance movements continue with support in influential places.{{#tag:ref|While people such as [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] and [[Richard Rogers]] represent the modernist movement, [[Prince Charles]] since the 1980s has voiced strong views against it in favour of traditional architecture and put his ideas into practice at his [[Poundbury]] development in Dorset.<ref name=ArchCon4>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8045027.stm|publisher=BBC News| title=Architects to hear Prince appeal | date=2009-05-12| accessdate=2009-06-20}}</ref> Architects like [[Raymond Erith]], [[Francis Johnson (architect)|Francis Johnson]] and [[Quinlan Terry]] continued to practice in the classical style.|group=note}}

[[File:Royal Arms of England (1198-1340).svg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A red shield tapers to its bottom end; on it are three stylised golden lions with blue claws.|The [[Royal Arms of England]]]]
The St George's Cross has been the national [[flag of England]] since the 13th century. Originally the flag was used by the maritime [[Republic of Genoa]]. The English monarch paid a tribute to the [[Doge of Genoa]] from 1190 onwards, so that English ships could fly the flag as a means of protection when entering the Mediterranean.
A red cross was a symbol for many [[Crusades|Crusaders]] in the 12th and 13th centuries. It became associated with [[Saint George]], along with countries and cities, which claimed him as their [[patron saint]] and used his cross as a banner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannia.com/history/stgeorge.html |title=St. George&nbsp;– England's Patron Saint |publisher=Britannia.com |date= |accessdate=1&nbsp;February 2009}}</ref> Since 1606 the St George's Cross has formed part of the design of the [[Union Flag]], a Pan-British flag designed by King [[James I of England|James I]].<ref name="flaghistory" />
[[File:Double Delight (Tudor) Rose.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A red and white flower.|The [[Tudor rose]], England's [[national flower|national floral emblem]]]]
There are numerous other symbols and symbolic artefacts, both official and unofficial, including the [[Tudor rose]], the nation's [[national emblem|floral emblem]], the [[dragon|White Dragon]], and the Three Lions featured on the [[Royal Arms of England]]. The Tudor rose was adopted as a national emblem of England around the time of the [[Wars of the Roses]] as a symbol of peace.<ref name="Flowers">{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page828|title=National flowers|date=2003-01-13|publisher=Number10.gov.uk|accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref> It is a [[syncreticism|syncretic]] symbol in that it merged the white rose of the [[House of York|Yorkists]] and the red rose of the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrians]]—cadet branches of the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenets]] who went to war over control of the nation. It is also known as the ''Rose of England''.<ref name="Rose">{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbynetwork.net/main/s245/st74325.htm|title=England's Rose&nbsp;– The Official History|last=Smith|first=Jed|date=2005-06-03|work=Museum of Rugby, Twickenham|publisher=RugbyNetwork.net|accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref> The [[oak|oak tree]] is a symbol of England, representing strength and endurance. The term [[Royal Oak]] alludes to the escape of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] from the grasp of the parliamentarians after his father's execution: he hid in an oak tree to avoid detection before safely reaching exile.

The Royal Arms of England, a national [[coat of arms]] featuring three lions, originated with its adoption by [[Richard the Lionheart]] in 1198. It is [[blazon]]ed as ''gules, three lions passant guardant or'' and it provides one of the most prominent symbols of England; it is similar to the traditional arms of [[Normandy]]. England does not have an official designated national anthem, as the United Kingdom as a whole has ''[[God Save the Queen]]''. However, the following are often considered unofficial English national anthems:
''[[Jerusalem (hymn)|Jerusalem]]'', ''[[Land of Hope and Glory]]'' (used for England during the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]]),<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200208050035 | title=Jason Cowley loves the Commonwealth Games| work=New Statesman| accessdate=2009-09-05}}</ref> and ''[[I Vow to Thee, My Country]]''. England's [[National Day]] is 23 April which is [[St George's Day]]: St George is the patron saint of England.<ref name="St. George">{{cite news | date=23 April 1998| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/82166.stm | title=The Great Saint George Revival|publisher=BBC News| accessdate=2009-09-05}}</ref>
